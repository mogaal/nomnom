Prerequisites
=============

* quvi  (0.2.16.1+)  <http://quvi.sourceforge.net/>
* umph  (0.1.6+)     <http://umph.googlecode.com/>
* curl  (7.20.0+)    <http://curl.haxx.se/>
* qt    (4.6+)       <http://qt.nokia.com/>
                        You can run "grep < configure.ac ^PKG" to get a
                        list of the Qt modules that nomnom uses
* qjson (0.7.1+)     <http://qjson.sourceforge.net>
* media player that supports streaming (e.g. vlc, mplayer)


Installation from source
========================

"./configure && make install", typically. See also "./configure --help".
If you are compiling nomnom from the development code from the git
repository, see "Installation from development code", instead.

  --enable-verbose    Enable --verbose program option
                        If enabled, the program can use --verbose to
                        turn on verbose output to stderr. Recommended
                        for debugging purposes only.

  --without-manual    Do not install manual pages


Installation from development code
==================================

If you are compiling nomnom from the development code, run "autogen.sh",
first. This generates the configuration files that are not in the git
repository. You will need:

  * Perl (with pod2man)
  * GNU autoconf
  * GNU automake

Once the files have been generated, follow the instructions of "Installation
from source" above.
