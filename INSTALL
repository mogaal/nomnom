    * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=(none|debug|release|relwithdebinfo|minsizerel)
        Type of build, default is "debug".

    * CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=(true,false)
        Build with verbose makefiles, default is "false".

Edit CMakeLists.txt file if you need to dig deeper.

NOTES FOR PACKAGERS

1) Porting.

Please ask the platform specific questions from those familiar with your
platform. We're currently Linux only.

If you need an additional check for, e.g. a symbol or a function, see the
top-level CMakeLists.txt file and the config.h.in file. We can add those
at the upstream if that makes porting easier.

2) Default system wide configuration file.

From users' perspective, configuring NomNom is likely the most demanding
part of the application.

Please consider including a preconfigured (e.g. system wide) config file
in your package tailored for your distro.

Open the Preferences, select Other to see where NomNom saves your config
file. You can use the file as a template for your package.

For example:

    quvi: /usr/bin/quvi %u
    curl: /usr/bin/curl -L -C - -o %f %u
    player: /usr/bin/vlc --quiet %u

NomNom sets the above values (without paths) by default if nothing was
found.

For the details, refer to the Qt's QSettings class reference and platform
specific notes (below) about the system wide configuration. On Unix-like
systems, QSettings typically checks the following paths:

    /etc/xdg/NomNom/NomNom.conf
    /etc/xdg/NomNom.conf
    /etc/NomNom.conf
    
Note that this may vary depending on how the Qt was configured and packaged
for your distro. See also:
