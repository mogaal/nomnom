NomNom
===========

NomNom is an application for downloading videos from Youtube and other similar
video websites that require Adobe Flash to view the video content. Video
streaming or downloading can be started simply by dropping an URL onto the
application window.

NomNom relies on a number of different other programs: quvi(1) to parse the
video links, curl(1) to download the videos, and a media streaming capable
player software, such as vlc(1), to stream the media. NomNom is written in
C++ to use the Qt framework.

The name of the application refers to the sound effect that is made when
eating something tasty or nutritious.

NOTES

  * Configuration

    Possibly the most difficult part of the application from a user's
    point of view. We have hardcoded some of the typical values for
    quvi(1), curl (1) and vlc(1) that NomNom uses as defaults to make
    this easier.
  
  * System wide configuration

    Packagers are encouraged to add a system wide configuration file
    to their NomNom packages with typical settings to their distros.
    Please read the "NOTES FOR PACKAGERS" in the INSTALL file.


GETTING STARTED

  * Right-click on the window to open the context-menu

  * Check the configuration (Preferences, Ctrl+E)

    - Check the paths to quvi(1), curl(1) and player (e.g. vlc(1))

      The default values should work on most systems out of the box.
      Make any changes you see necessary.

  * Drag and drop video page URLs from, for example, your web browser.
  This starts the download (or streaming if selected).

  * You can make NomNom stay on top of other windows (Preferences / Other).
  This will make it easier to use NomNom if you have limited screen space.

  * Nomnom resumes file transfers by default (determined by the curl command
  in the Preferences). Check "Overwrite" in the context menu if you want to
  overwrite the existing files.
