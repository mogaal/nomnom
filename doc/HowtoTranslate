HOWTO: Translate
================

NOTES

If you are unsure where NomNom saves the config file, open the Preferences
(Ctrl+E) and choose "Other". The same info is also available in the About
dialog.

  * You can set "qmShowPaths=true" in your config file to have NomNom dump
  the qm search paths. They are printed to stderr in addition to displayed
  in the "Select language" dialog.

    [General]
    qmShowPaths=true

  * You can add an additional qm search path by adding "qmPath=$path" to your
  config file, e.g.:

    [General]
    qmPath=/path/to/my/qmfiles

  * The "About" dialog HTML content (containing the version information, etc.)
  does not necessarily need to be translated, if you do however, consider
  leaving the GPL for <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/translations.html>


CREATING NEW TRANSLATION

Checklist

  1) Get the latest source code from <http://nomnom.sourceforge.net/>

     - Please do not use the NomNom git repository code for this,
     the development code is a subject to frequent changes

  2) Install the required Qt tools, e.g. lupdate, lrelease, linguist

Get started

  1) cd to the top source code dir

  2) Run "mkdir tmp; cd tmp; cmake ..; mkdir tr"

  3) Run "lupdate src/ i/ -ts tr/nomnom_$locale.ts"
    e.g. "lupdate src/ i/ -ts tr/nomnom_fi.ts" # for Finnish

  4) Edit (translate) the created tr/nomnom_$locale.ts file
    e.g. linguist tr/nomnom_$locale.ts

Test translation

  5) Run "make && mv nomnom_$locale.qm tr/ && ./nomnom"

  Or, copy the produced qm file to one of the following paths:

    $config_qmPath
    `cwd`/tr
    ~/.config/nomnom/tr/
    ~/.local/share/nomnom/tr/
    $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/nomnom/tr/

  Alternatively, use linguist (File / Release).

  6) Run "./nomnom".
  
    Skip if you have done this previously:
        - Open Preferences / Other
        - Click "Language..." and select the language
        - Restart NomNom

    Check that everything looks as it should.

  7) Repeat steps 4-6 until you are happy with the results.


UPDATE EXISTING TRANSLATION

The existing strings may change sometimes. We are also constantly adding new
ones as the project evolves. This means that the translations must be updated
accordingly.

Checklist
  * See "CREATING NEW TRANSLATION" and "Checklist" above

Get started

  1) cd to the top source code dir

  2) Run "lupdate -no-obsolete src/ i/ -ts tr/nomnom_$locale.ts"

Test the updated translation

  See the steps 4-7 under "CREATING NEW TRANSLATION" and "Test translation"
  above.


SUBMIT TRANSLATION

We can add your translation at the upstream to the distribution.
Open a new ticket to the Feature tracker at:
    <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nomnom/support/>

And submit your ts file.
Thanks!
