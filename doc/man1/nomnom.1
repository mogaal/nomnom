.SH "NAME"
NomNom \- The graphical media download tool
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"

media websites that require flash to view the media content. Media streaming
or downloading can be started by dropping an \s-1URL\s0 onto the application window.

.SS "Right-click opens the context-menu"
.IX Subsection "Right-click opens the context-menu"
Most the application features can be accessed via this menu.
.SS "Check the settings (Ctrl+E)"
.IX Subsection "Check the settings (Ctrl+E)"
NomNom will attempt to detect the available commands when you run it the
first time. Going over the settings before use is recommended. The
dialog will not close (by clicking \s-1OK\s0) unless you have entered
everything needed.
.SS "Check that NomNom is set to do what you expect"
.IX Subsection "Check that NomNom is set to do what you expect"
Make a note of the combobox widget on the main window. You may choose to
either \f(CW\*(C`Download\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Stream\*(C'\fR from the widget.
.SS "Drop media page URLs to main window"
.IX Subsection "Drop media page URLs to main window"
You could, for example, have a web browser open from which you then drag
the URLs onto the main window of NomNom. Alternatively, open the
right-click context-menu and choose \f(CW\*(C`Address...\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You may also consider making sure that NomNom stays on top of other
windows if you are working on a small screen. There is an option for
this in the application settings.
.SS "NomNom defaults to resume interrupted transfers"
.IX Subsection "NomNom defaults to resume interrupted transfers"
See also the \*(L"\s-1KNOWN\s0 \s-1ISSUES\s0\*(R" for more about this. You can also choose
to overwrite any existing media files if you'd prefer this.
.SS "You can grab media page URLs from YouTube feeds"
.IX Subsection "You can grab media page URLs from YouTube feeds"
Choose \f(CW\*(C`Feed...\*(C'\fR from the context-menu or hit the key-shortcut (Ctrl+F)
to open the dialog.
.SH "COMMAND LINE"

.IX Subsection "--help"
Prints the help and exits.
.SS "\-\-version"
.IX Subsection "--version"
Prints the version and exits.
.SH "GLOSSARY"
.IX Header "GLOSSARY"
.SS "Media page \s-1URL\s0"

main window to start the process of downloading (or streaming).
.PP
These URLs are known to go around also as \f(CW\*(C`video page URLs\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIExample\fR
.IX Subsection "Example"
.PP
http://vimeo.com/1485507
.SS "Media stream \s-1URL\s0"

Not to be confused with \*(L"Media page \s-1URL\s0\*(R". The media \fIstream\fR \s-1URL\s0 is
the \s-1URL\s0 to the media resource that is returned by the \f(CWquvi(1)\fR
command and then used by NomNom to either download or stream from it.
.SS "YouTube feeds"
.IX Subsection "YouTube feeds"
NomNom can read, with the help of \f(CWumph(1)\fR command, and grab media
URLs from YouTube feeds. These feeds may be \fIplaylists\fR, user
\&\fIfavorites\fR and user \fIuploads\fR.
.PP
You can open the user-interface by selecting it from the right-click
context-menu (\f(CW\*(C`Feed...\*(C'\fR) or by hitting the key-shortcut (Ctrl+F).
.SS "YouTube format strings"

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#Quality_and_codecs
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
.IX Header "KNOWN ISSUES"
.SS "Resuming partially transferred files may fail"
.IX Subsection "Resuming partially transferred files may fail"
Some websites are known to refuse to work with the \s-1HTTP\s0 requests to
resume a file transfer.
.PP
\fIWorkaround\fR
.IX Subsection "Workaround"
.PP
Either check \*(L"Always overwrite existing media files\*(R" in the settings
or remove the existing file manually.
.SS "\s-1HTTP\s0 user-agent"
.IX Subsection "HTTP user-agent"
Some websites refuse to play nice with renegade user-agent strings.
.PP
\fIRecommendations\fR
.IX Subsection "Recommendations"
.PP
Make sure both \f(CWquvi(1)\fR and \f(CWcurl(1)\fR use the same user-agent string.
Note that \f(CWquvi(1)\fR uses \*(L"Mozilla/5.0\*(R" by default.
.SS "\s-1HTTP\s0 proxy"
.IX Subsection "HTTP proxy"
Generally \s-1OK\s0, although some proxies may have been configured to
\&\f(CW\*(C`cook up\*(C'\fR the \s-1HTTP\s0 headers before they are sent back to the server.
This may sometimes lead to issues with the servers.
.PP
\fIRecommendations\fR
.IX Subsection "Recommendations"
.PP
If you use an \s-1HTTP\s0 proxy, make sure you have configured all of the commands
that NomNom uses (e.g. \f(CWquvi(1)\fR, \f(CWcurl(1)\fR, etc.) to use the same proxy.
.SH "TIPS"
.IX Header "TIPS"
.SS "Use configuration files"
.IX Subsection "Use configuration files"
Although it is possible to configure custom commands for NomNom to use
(via \f(CW\*(C`settings\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`commands\*(C'\fR), another way is to add/edit the appropriate
configuration files for these commands.
